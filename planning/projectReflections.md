# socialite development reflections

##### Checkpoints

* checkpoint 1:
    * I found I had to remind myself the screen designs should be simple and are used to come up with a starting 
    structure which will need changes later on, but the important part is to get a good foundation to from on.
    
    * I had fun coming up with the initial plan and structure for this project; I anticipate small changes but for the 
    most part I feel like I have a good idea of the route im going to take in developing this web app.
